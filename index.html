The Belgium Algorithm Contest (BAC) is a series of montly individual algorithmic programming contests
between Belgium universities organized by <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/index.html">Universit√© catholique de Louvain</a>. 
It can be used by each university as a selection for the
students that will compete in the <a href="https://2016.bapc.eu/en/">BAPC</a> and 
<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a> contests. 
  </p>
  <p>
The goal of each participant is to solve as many algorithmic problems as possible within the set time limit. 
Solutions need to be programmed on a computer and can be submitted to a semi-automated judging system.
  </p>
  <p>
Because we aim at having several universities competing at the same time, the contests will be online. Unless stated otherwise,
each contest will be held on the last weekend of each month.
Check the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a> for more information. To allow everyone to find a suitable time to participate, 
each contest will take place on a whole weekend. Once you login you will have 2h30m to solve as many problems as you can (there
will be arround 5 problems). At the end of the weekend a scoreboard with everyone's results will be available here.
